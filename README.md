# Interview Resources

This repo was initially home to the just the "external resources" listed below, but has since grown a bit as I'm starting to include some opinionated advice for approaching software development interview prep as well. So far, I have written the following:

- [Leetcode-style interviews](./leetcode)
- [Behavioral interviews](./behavioral)
- Other interview types coming soon!

Thanks for checking out the repository! If you'd like to support me or this work, (1) star this repo and/or (2) give me a follow on [Github](https://github.com/nas5w) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/nas5w).

# External Resources

I find big lists overwhelming. Here's a non-overwhelming list of resources I use for software development interview prep.

## Handbooks

These handbooks aim to cover all aspects of tech interview prep.

# Contributing to this list

I'm happy to discuss adding resources to this list, but one of my goals is to keep it lean. I find really large lists to be unapproachable. If you'd still like to recommend a resource, create an issue and I'll review it. Just a fair warning that I will be very discerning before adding things to the list!
